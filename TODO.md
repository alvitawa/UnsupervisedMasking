Dual masked head / Head remapping / fixed seed
SSL loss for finetuning (first SWAV, then DINO)
Free method â€“ Does it find the optimal prune rate?
One more dataset (CIFAR100 CIFAR10 Flowers Food EuroSAT SUN UCF SVHN Pets DTD RESISC CLEVR, CUBS, Stanford Cars, WikiArt, Sketch datasets, STL)
Test if dreambooth is feasible computationally
Play around a bit more with resnet18 and flowers
Dont linear probe for submasking experiments
Exponential moving average
Resnet sizes plot - add standard finetunes
